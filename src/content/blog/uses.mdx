# Uses

Here is a list of some of the gear, software and apps I use on a daily basis in my attempt to make the world a better place.

If you want to see what other developers are using, check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) for a list of everyone's uses pages.

### Editor + Terminal

- I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I tried to switch to Neovim but it was too much of a pain to get set up. I might try again in the future.
- My current theme is [Winter is Coming](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.winteriscoming) with the [Recursive Mono](https://www.recursive.design/) font. For the icons I use [Bearded Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BeardedBear.beardedicons).
- My terminal is [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) but most of the time I just use the built in VS Code terminal.

### Desktop Apps

- I have been using [Arc](https://arc.net/) as my main browser for a while now. The experience is great and it's built on top of Chrome so all my extensions work.
- For window management I use [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/).
- I use [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) for quick access to all my apps and workflows. I never tried Alfred but I've heard it's good too.
- I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for all my notes, reminders, todos, project planning, etc.

### Desk Setup

- My computer is a 2018 15" MacBook Pro.
- My monitor is a 35" [ASUS TUF Gaming VG35VQ](https://www.asus.com/displays-desktops/monitors/tuf-gaming/tuf-gaming-vg35vq/).
- My Keyboard is a [IQUNIX F96 Coral Sea](https://iqunix.store/products/iqunix-f97-coral-sea-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) and my mouse is a [Logitech MX Master 3s](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s.910-006556.html) but sometimes I switch to a regular magic mouse.
- I put my Mac on a [Bestand laptop stand](https://www.amazon.com/Laptop-Stand-Aluminum-Computer-Notebooks/dp/B074DTL449/ref=sr_1_3?crid=MLUN31F6J6JB&keywords=bestand%2Blaptop%2Bstand&qid=1696094687&sprefix=bestand%2Caps%2C162&sr=8-3&th=1).
- To connect everything to my mac I use a [Satechi Type-C adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Multimedia-Adapter-Gigabit-Ethernet/dp/B07RH8L9GV/ref=sr_1_19?crid=VI4GTQVW7ZIU&keywords=satechi%2Busb%2Bc%2Bhub&qid=1696095398&sprefix=satechi%2B%2Caps%2C184&sr=8-19&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0&th=1).
- My desk is an standing desk from [ErgoCR](https://ergocr.com/). I highly recommend it. It's a bit expensive but it's worth it.

### Other Gear

- I listen to [Bose Headphones 700](https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Cancelling-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B07Q9MJKBV/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1G6X8EO1D3BOS&keywords=bose+noise+cancelling+headphones+700&qid=1696095551&sprefix=bose+no%2Caps%2C174&sr=8-3&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.c3015c4a-46bb-44b9-81a4-dc28e6d374b3) all day at my desk and AirPods Pro when I'm out.
